# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The walk-up music manager application has several mobile UI issues that prevent proper functionality on mobile devices. The most critical issues are in the SegmentSelector component where users cannot access Cancel and Submit buttons when they are pushed off-screen, but the underlying problem is that the entire application needs a responsive design overhaul. The app currently relies heavily on media queries and fixed pixel values that don't adapt well to different screen sizes and mobile viewports. This spec addresses these mobile usability problems with a comprehensive responsive design solution using modern CSS viewport units and flexible layouts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the entire application to use responsive design units and flexible layouts, so that all components adapt properly to different screen sizes without requiring complex media queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing any component layout THEN the system SHALL use viewport units (vw, vh, vmin, vmax, dvh, dvw) for sizing
2. WHEN laying out components THEN the system SHALL use CSS Grid or Flexbox for responsive behavior
3. WHEN setting dimensions THEN the system SHALL avoid fixed pixel values that don't scale with viewport
4. WHEN the viewport changes THEN all components SHALL adapt fluidly without media query breakpoints
5. IF specific sizing is needed THEN it SHALL use relative units (rem, em, vmin, vmax) that scale with the viewport
6. WHEN replacing existing styles THEN the system SHALL prioritize CSS functions (clamp, min, max) over media queries

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want all modal dialogs and action buttons to always be visible and accessible, so that I can complete or cancel any operation without interface elements being pushed off-screen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any modal opens on mobile THEN all action buttons SHALL be visible within the viewport
2. WHEN the virtual keyboard appears on mobile THEN buttons SHALL remain accessible without requiring scrolling
3. WHEN modal content is tall THEN action buttons SHALL stay fixed at the bottom of the modal
4. WHEN the user scrolls within modal content THEN action buttons SHALL remain visible and clickable
5. IF the viewport height is very small THEN modals SHALL adjust their layout to ensure button accessibility
6. WHEN designing button layouts THEN the system SHALL ensure minimum touch target sizes of 44px or 8vmin

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to be able to scroll the page normally after closing any modal dialog, so that I can continue navigating the application without interface issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any modal is closed THEN the page scrolling SHALL be restored to normal behavior
2. WHEN any modal is cancelled or confirmed THEN the body overflow style SHALL be reset properly
3. WHEN any modal component unmounts THEN any scroll-blocking styles SHALL be cleaned up
4. WHEN multiple modals are opened and closed THEN scrolling SHALL work correctly after all are closed
5. IF any modal closes unexpectedly THEN the scroll behavior SHALL still be restored
6. WHEN implementing scroll management THEN the system SHALL use a centralized approach for consistency

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want all play/pause buttons throughout the application to accurately reflect the current playback state, so that I know whether music is playing or paused regardless of which component I'm using.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click any play button THEN it SHALL change to show a pause button and pause text
2. WHEN I click any pause button THEN it SHALL change to show a play button and play text
3. WHEN music stops automatically after any duration THEN the button SHALL revert to play state
4. WHEN playback fails THEN all play buttons SHALL revert to play state
5. WHEN any modal is closed during playback THEN the playback SHALL stop and all button states SHALL reset
6. WHEN implementing playback controls THEN the system SHALL use centralized state management for consistency

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want components to have configurable UI elements based on context, so that interfaces are clean and appropriate for their specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN song search results are displayed THEN they SHALL not include play buttons by default
2. WHEN I view a song result THEN I SHALL only see song information and a select button
3. WHEN I want to preview a song THEN I SHALL use the preview functionality in appropriate contexts
4. WHEN reusable components are used in different contexts THEN they SHALL support configuration props
5. IF play buttons are needed in specific contexts THEN they SHALL be explicitly enabled via component props
6. WHEN designing reusable components THEN the system SHALL prioritize context-appropriate defaults
