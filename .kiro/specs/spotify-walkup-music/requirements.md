# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a web application that allows baseball team managers or players to create and manage walk-up music playlists using Spotify. The application will enable users to authenticate with Spotify, select specific segments of songs for each player, arrange them in a batting order, and play them sequentially during a game. All data will be stored locally in the browser's local storage without requiring remote storage.
