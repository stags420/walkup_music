- [ ] 11. Test Coverage and Quality Issues
  - [ ] 11.1 Fix incomplete test in player-management.test.js
    - File: tests/js/components/player-management.test.js, line 492
    - The diff shows an incomplete test case that was cut off mid-execution
    - The test appears to be testing song selection retrieval but the assertion was incomplete
    - Fix: Complete the test case or remove the incomplete code
    - _Requirements: 2.6_

  - [ ] 11.2 Restore missing UI test coverage
    - File: tests/js/components/player-management.test.js, lines 490-618 (removed in diff)
    - Critical UI functionality tests were removed including player list display, empty state handling, and error state testing
    - These tests covered requirement 2.6 for player list display functionality
    - The removed tests included important edge cases like handling service errors and displaying players with/without song selections
    - Fix: Either restore the removed UI tests or create equivalent tests that cover the same functionality
    - _Requirements: 2.6_

  - [ ] 11.3 Add integration tests for UI components
    - File: tests/js/components/player-management.test.js
    - The current tests only cover service layer functionality but don't test the actual UI component integration
    - Missing tests for DOM manipulation, event handling, and user interaction flows
    - The removed tests were attempting to test UI functionality but were incomplete
    - Fix: Create proper integration tests that test the actual player management UI component
    - _Requirements: 2.6_

  - [ ] 11.4 Verify test consistency with actual implementation
    - File: tests/js/components/player-management.test.js
    - The test file creates a mock implementation of playerManagementService but doesn't verify it matches the actual service
    - Risk of tests passing while actual implementation has bugs
    - Fix: Either import and test the actual service or ensure mock implementation stays in sync
    - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6_
