# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for refactoring the existing Spotify Walk-up Music JavaScript application to TypeScript. The refactoring will enhance code maintainability, provide better developer experience through type safety, and improve overall code quality while preserving all existing functionality. The migration will be performed incrementally to minimize disruption and ensure all features continue to work as expected.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: TypeScript Infrastructure Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to be properly configured for TypeScript development, so that I can benefit from type checking, better IDE support, and improved code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is configured THEN the system SHALL include TypeScript compiler configuration with appropriate settings for a web application
2. WHEN building the project THEN the system SHALL compile TypeScript files to JavaScript with source maps for debugging
3. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL support TypeScript test files with proper type checking
4. WHEN developing THEN the system SHALL provide proper IDE support with IntelliSense and error highlighting
5. IF TypeScript compilation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the issues

### Requirement 2: Type Definitions and Interfaces

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive type definitions for all data structures and APIs, so that I can catch type-related errors at compile time and have better code documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining data models THEN the system SHALL provide TypeScript interfaces for all model classes (Player, SongSelection, BattingOrder, AppState)
2. WHEN working with Spotify API THEN the system SHALL include type definitions for all API responses and requests
3. WHEN using storage utilities THEN the system SHALL provide typed interfaces for storage operations
4. WHEN handling validation THEN the system SHALL define typed validation result interfaces
5. IF external libraries are used THEN the system SHALL include appropriate type definitions or declaration files

### Requirement 3: Model Layer Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the data models to be properly typed, so that I can ensure data integrity and catch model-related errors at compile time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating player models THEN the system SHALL enforce type safety for all player properties and methods
2. WHEN creating song selection models THEN the system SHALL validate types for track information, timing data, and player references
3. WHEN managing batting order THEN the system SHALL ensure type safety for order operations and player ID references
4. WHEN handling application state THEN the system SHALL provide typed state management with proper validation
5. IF model validation fails THEN the system SHALL return properly typed error objects with specific error information

### Requirement 4: Utility Functions Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want utility functions to be properly typed, so that I can use them safely throughout the application with compile-time guarantees.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using storage utilities THEN the system SHALL provide generic typed functions for saving and retrieving data
2. WHEN handling cookies THEN the system SHALL ensure type safety for cookie operations and authentication tokens
3. WHEN working with URLs THEN the system SHALL provide typed URL manipulation functions
4. WHEN using navigation utilities THEN the system SHALL enforce proper typing for navigation operations
5. IF utility functions receive invalid parameters THEN the system SHALL catch these errors at compile time

### Requirement 5: Component Layer Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all application components to be properly typed, so that component interactions are type-safe and component APIs are well-defined.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing authentication components THEN the system SHALL provide typed interfaces for authentication state and operations
2. WHEN managing player components THEN the system SHALL ensure type safety for player management operations and UI interactions
3. WHEN integrating with Spotify API THEN the system SHALL provide typed API client with proper error handling
4. WHEN handling player management services THEN the system SHALL define typed service interfaces and implementations
5. IF component methods are called with wrong parameters THEN the system SHALL catch these errors at compile time

### Requirement 6: Test Migration and Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests to be migrated to TypeScript, so that test code benefits from type safety and tests can catch type-related regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running unit tests THEN the system SHALL execute TypeScript test files with proper type checking
2. WHEN testing models THEN the system SHALL provide typed test utilities and assertions
3. WHEN testing components THEN the system SHALL ensure type safety in component testing and mocking
4. WHEN testing API integrations THEN the system SHALL provide typed mocks for external services
5. IF test code has type errors THEN the system SHALL fail compilation and provide clear error messages

### Requirement 7: Build System Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build system to handle TypeScript compilation seamlessly, so that the development workflow remains efficient while gaining TypeScript benefits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for development THEN the system SHALL compile TypeScript with fast incremental compilation
2. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL optimize TypeScript compilation and generate appropriate output
3. WHEN watching for changes THEN the system SHALL recompile only changed TypeScript files for fast development cycles
4. WHEN generating source maps THEN the system SHALL provide accurate debugging information linking compiled JavaScript to TypeScript source
5. IF compilation errors occur THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages with file locations and suggestions

### Requirement 8: Backward Compatibility and Migration Safety

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the TypeScript migration to preserve all existing functionality, so that no features are broken during the refactoring process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating files THEN the system SHALL maintain identical runtime behavior for all existing functionality
2. WHEN running existing tests THEN the system SHALL pass all current test cases without modification to test logic
3. WHEN using the application THEN the system SHALL provide the same user experience and feature set as before migration
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL generate JavaScript output that is compatible with the existing deployment process
5. IF any functionality changes THEN the system SHALL document these changes and ensure they are intentional improvements

### Requirement 9: Developer Experience Improvements

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved development tools and IDE support, so that I can be more productive and write higher quality code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing code THEN the system SHALL provide IntelliSense with accurate autocompletion and parameter hints
2. WHEN refactoring THEN the system SHALL support safe renaming and refactoring operations across the codebase
3. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL provide accurate source map support for debugging TypeScript code
4. WHEN importing modules THEN the system SHALL provide proper import/export type checking and suggestions
5. IF code has potential issues THEN the system SHALL highlight these issues in the IDE with helpful suggestions

### Requirement 10: Documentation and Type Coverage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation of types and interfaces, so that I can understand and maintain the codebase effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing code THEN the system SHALL provide JSDoc comments with proper TypeScript type annotations
2. WHEN generating documentation THEN the system SHALL include type information in generated documentation
3. WHEN measuring type coverage THEN the system SHALL achieve high type coverage across the codebase
4. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN the system SHALL provide clear examples of TypeScript usage patterns in the project
5. IF types are unclear THEN the system SHALL provide detailed type definitions and usage examples
