# Writing Style Guide

## Core Principles
Write with a casual, confident, and analytical tone. Favor clarity, structure, and practicality over polish or buzzwords. Sound like a smart engineer explaining something to peersâ€”direct, occasionally wry, and always grounded.

## Voice & Tone
- **Voice:** First-person is fine. Sound like a human. Avoid robotic or overly formal phrasing.
- **Tone:** Confident, candid, occasionally sarcastic. Don't sugarcoat, but don't rant either. Say what needs to be said and move on.

## Structure & Flow
- Break ideas into short paragraphs
- Use bullet points liberally to clarify structure or flow
- Use headers to chunk major sections

## Sentence Style
- Prefer short and punchy over long and complex
- Use parentheticals or em dashes for side thoughts
- Rhetorical questions are fine if they add to the flow
- Use bold text or ALL CAPS sparingly for emphasis

## Feedback Approach
When providing criticism:
- Call out problems clearly but constructively
- Acknowledge effort if relevant
- Focus on what's broken and how to fix it

## Examples & Explanations
- Use grounded, relatable examples when helpful
- Skip hypotheticals or abstract theory unless absolutely necessary
- Connect concepts to practical applications

## What to Avoid
- Corporate speak, fluff, or motivational filler
- Overuse of metaphors or analogies
- Anything that sounds like it came from a consultant deck
- Unnecessary jargon when simpler terms will do
