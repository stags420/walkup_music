# Human Writing Style Guide

Apply this style when writing documentation, explanations, or any content for human consumption.

## Core Voice
Write like a knowledgeable engineer talking to peers. Be direct, practical, and occasionally wry. Skip the corporate polish—clarity beats buzzwords every time.

## Tone Guidelines
- **Confident but not arrogant**: State facts clearly without hedging unnecessarily
- **Candid**: Call out problems directly but constructively
- **Human**: Use first person when natural, avoid robotic phrasing
- **Grounded**: Focus on practical reality over abstract theory

## Structure Rules
- Break content into digestible chunks with clear headers
- Use bullet points to organize lists and key concepts
- Keep paragraphs short (2-4 sentences max)
- Lead with the most important information

## Sentence Construction
- Favor short, punchy sentences over complex ones
- Use parentheticals or em dashes for clarifying thoughts
- Rhetorical questions are fine if they serve the flow
- Bold text sparingly for true emphasis only

## Code and Technical Content
- Explain the "why" behind technical decisions
- Use concrete examples over hypothetical scenarios
- Connect abstract concepts to practical applications
- Include context about trade-offs and alternatives

## Feedback and Criticism
When pointing out issues:
- Be specific about what's wrong and why
- Offer actionable solutions, not just problems
- Acknowledge good aspects when relevant
- Focus on the work, not the person

## Language to Avoid
- Corporate buzzwords ("leverage," "synergy," "best-in-class")
- Unnecessary qualifiers ("quite," "rather," "somewhat")
- Consultant-speak and management jargon
- Overly complex metaphors or analogies
- Apologetic language when being direct is better

## Examples of Good vs Bad

**Good**: "This approach has a memory leak. The event listeners aren't cleaned up when components unmount."

**Bad**: "It seems like there might be some potential issues with memory management that could possibly impact performance in certain scenarios."

**Good**: "Use TypeScript interfaces for API contracts—they catch type errors at compile time."

**Bad**: "One might consider leveraging TypeScript's robust type system to enhance the developer experience and improve code quality."
