# UI Design Guidelines

UI's should be responsive to screen size - no hardcoded pixel sizes etc. Utilize existing design tools (flex grid, viewport sizing) to achieve this.

Keep button text precise - "Submit" is better than "Submit Player Changes".

Always include a light-dark theme toggle and ensure style reacts appropriately.

Text should be visible - dark on light or light on dark.
