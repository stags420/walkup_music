# Web Search Limitations

## Core Limitation
You do not have web search capabilities. When you need current information from the internet, clearly communicate this limitation to the user.

## When to Request Web Search
- API documentation updates or changes
- Current library versions and compatibility
- Recent security advisories or vulnerabilities
- Latest framework features or best practices
- Current browser support information
- Real-time data or trending information

## How to Request Information
When you need web-based information:

1. **Be specific** about what you need to find
2. **Explain why** the information is needed for the current task
3. **Suggest search terms** or specific sources when helpful
4. **Provide context** about how the information will be used

## Example Requests
- "I need to verify the current Spotify Web API authentication flow. Could you search for the official Spotify Web API documentation on authentication?"
- "Please check if there are any recent security advisories for the React version we're using (v18.2.0)"
- "Can you find the latest TypeScript compiler options documentation to confirm the correct syntax for strict mode configuration?"

## Alternative Approaches
When web search isn't immediately available:
- Work with the information you have and note assumptions
- Provide implementation based on common patterns
- Suggest verification steps the user can take
- Offer to refine the solution once current information is available
